# Utilities for T450s

This is where I'll store useful but optional hacks for the laptop

## Color Profile

This will download and put the color profile calibrated using Spyder Pro on the TN Panel

`cd /Library/ColorSync/Profiles/Displays/`

`wget link`

This will ask for admin password beacuse we're modifiying System. Put the password and then change the profile from `System Preferences -> Display -> Color`
